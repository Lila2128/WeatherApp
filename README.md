# Weather App

<h3> Project overview </h3>
<p>
  This project is a great way to learn the basics of front-end web development and APIs. This is a functional weather app that retrieves weather data using an API and displays it in a visually appealing way.
This app will ask your permission to locate your location for accurate weather forecast of your location. 
</p>

<h3> Application Features </h3>
● Home Page will show you a pop up request to locate your location. If permitted it will directly locate your location through geolocation which your browser supports.<br>
● If not supported or if you block the request then it will give you an error message and you can provide manually the city name in the search bar. <br>
● Accordingly the function will set the latitude and longitude to the API link dynamically to fetch the forecast. <br>
● It shows the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions as well as following 5 days forecast. <br>
● To represent weather conditions, we will use icons or images like a sun or a cloud.
